## TODOs
- [x] A button to start the service / app itself as a shortcut to stop
- [x] Log service cycle in details
- [x] Review log statements and level
- [x] Add pause/resume on notification bar
- [x] Allow users to specify dictionary to use.
- [x] Bug fixes
  - [x] Livio's dictionaries do not support colordict action well.
  - [x] Clipboard Data null handling
- [x] Misc. UI cleanup
  - [x] UI layout / style in todos
  - [x] Notification title (using app name is redundant)
  - [x] Prompt users to start service after selecting a dictionary
- [x] i18N
- [ ] More info on supported dictionaries, or broaden the list of supported dictionaries (with other more generic intent action)
- [ ] Testing 
  - [x] complete various scenarios in androidTest
  - [x] refactor so that StubPackageManger can be injected before Activity is created (hence used in onCreate())
  - [x] create a PackageManagerLite interface so that I can create a stub without using mock (mock is slow on devices)
- [ ] Consider to adopt data binding (which could help to move activity logic outside to a standalone UI Model for testing)  
  - [x] initial pilot
  - [ ] incorporate to master
  - [ ] binding listeners too?
